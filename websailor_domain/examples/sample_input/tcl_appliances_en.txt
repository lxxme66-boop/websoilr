TCL has expanded its smart home appliance portfolio with the launch of the new FreshIN+ series refrigerators. These refrigerators feature TCL's proprietary Multi Air Flow technology, which ensures uniform temperature distribution throughout all compartments.

The flagship model, TCL-RF636WD, comes with a total capacity of 636 liters and utilizes inverter compressor technology for enhanced energy efficiency. The refrigerator achieves an A++ energy rating, consuming only 280 kWh annually. The dual-cooling system maintains optimal humidity levels in both the refrigerator and freezer sections independently.

TCL's innovative T-Fresh technology incorporates a specialized filter system that eliminates up to 99.9% of bacteria and maintains food freshness for extended periods. The refrigerator also features a dedicated fresh zone with adjustable temperature settings ranging from -2°C to 5°C, ideal for storing meat and seafood.

In the washing machine category, TCL's TWM-120B model introduces the Steam Wash function, which effectively removes stubborn stains while being gentle on fabrics. The machine offers 16 different wash programs, including specialized cycles for wool, silk, and sportswear. With a maximum spin speed of 1200 RPM and a load capacity of 12 kg, it caters to large families.

The air conditioning division has introduced the Elite Series, featuring the GentleCool technology that prevents direct cold air flow onto users. The TCL-TAC-18CSA model achieves an impressive SEER rating of 6.1, making it one of the most energy-efficient units in its class. The built-in PM2.5 filter and UV sterilization function ensure clean and healthy air circulation.

All TCL smart appliances can be controlled through the TCL Home app, which provides remote monitoring, scheduling, and energy consumption tracking. The app supports integration with major smart home ecosystems including Google Home and Amazon Alexa, enabling voice control functionality across the entire product range.
